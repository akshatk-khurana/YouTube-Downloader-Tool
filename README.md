# YouTube-Downloader-Tool
A lightweight and extremely handy YouTube downloader command line tool made with Python's sys and pytube3 modules.

### main.py
'YOUR PATH' is the location on your computer (or path) on which you want the downloader to save downloaded files.

### yt
Executable file version of main.py. 
It includes a shebang and will need to be added to PATH. Full instructions on how to do so and make the tool available across all terminal sessions can be gotten from https://dbader.org/blog/how-to-make-command-line-commands-with-python, which I stumbled across as I was building this project.
